\poemtitle{Earth's Answer}

\begin{poem}

\begin{stanza}
Earth raised up her head\verseline
From the darkness dread and drear,\verseline
Her light fled,\verseline
Stony, dread,\verseline
And her locks covered with grey despair.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
"Prisoned on watery shore,\verseline
Starry jealousy does keep my den\verseline
Cold and hoar;\verseline
Weeping o'er,\verseline
I hear the father of the ancient men.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
"Selfish father of men!\verseline
Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!\verseline
Can delight,\verseline
Chained in night,\verseline
The virgins of youth and morning bear?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
"Does spring hide its joy,\verseline
When buds and blossoms grow?\verseline
Does the sower\verseline
Sow by night,\verseline
Or the plowman in darkness plough?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
"Break this heavy chain,\verseline
That does freeze my bones around!\verseline
Selfish, vain,\verseline
Eternal bane,\verseline
That free love with bondage bound."
\end{stanza}
