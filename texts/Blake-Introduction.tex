\begin{poem}

\begin{stanza}
Piping down the valleys wild,\verseline
\verseindent Piping songs of pleasant glee,\verseline
On a cloud I saw a child,\verseline
\verseindent And he laughing said to me:
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
"Pipe a song about a Lamb!"\verseline
\verseindent So I piped with merry cheer.\verseline
"Piper, pipe that song again;"\verseline
\verseindent So I piped: he wept to hear.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
"Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;\verseline
\verseindent Sing thy songs of happy cheer!"\verseline
So I sang the same again,\verseline
\verseindent While he wept with joy to hear.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
"Piper, sit thee down and write\verseline
\verseindent In a book, that all may read."\verseline
So he vanish'd from my sight;\verseline
\verseindent And I pluck'd a hollow reed,
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
And I made a rural pen,\verseline
\verseindent And I stain'd the water clear,\verseline
And I wrote my happy songs\verseline
\verseindent Every child may joy to hear.
\end{stanza}
