\poemtitle{The Echoing Green}

\begin{poem}

\begin{stanza}
The sun does arise,\verseline
And make happy the skies;\verseline
The merry bells ring\verseline
To welcome the Spring;\verseline
The skylark and thrush,\verseline
The birds of the bush,\verseline
Sing louder around\verseline
To the bells' cheerful sound;\verseline
While our sports shall be seen\verseline
On the echoing Green.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
\verseindent Old John, with white hair,\verseline
Does laugh away care,\verseline
Sitting under the oak,\verseline
Among the old folk.\verseline
They laugh at our play,\verseline
And soon they all say,\verseline
"Such, such were the joys\verseline
When we all—girls and boys—\verseline
In our youth-time were seen\verseline
On the echoing Green."
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
\verseindent Till the little ones, weary,\verseline
No more can be merry:\verseline
The sun does descend,\verseline
And our sports have an end.\verseline
Round the laps of their mothers\verseline
Many sisters and brothers,\verseline
Like birds in their nest,\verseline
Are ready for rest,\verseline
And sport no more seen\verseline
On the darkening green.
\end{stanza}
