\poemtitle{The Tyger}

\begin{poem}

\begin{stanza}
Tyger, tyger, burning bright\verseline
In the forests of the night,\verseline
What immortal hand or eye\verseline
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
\verseindent In what distant deeps or skies\verseline
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?\verseline
On what wings dare he aspire?\verseline
What the hand dare seize the fire?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
\verseindent And what shoulder and what art\verseline
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?\verseline
And, when thy heart began to beat,\verseline
What dread hand and what dread feet?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
\verseindent What the hammer? what the chain?\verseline
In what furnace was thy brain?\verseline
What the anvil? what dread grasp\verseline
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
\verseindent When the stars threw down their spears,\verseline
And watered heaven with their tears,\verseline
Did he smile his work to see?\verseline
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
\verseindent Tyger, tyger, burning bright\verseline
In the forests of the night,\verseline
What immortal hand or eye\verseline
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
\end{stanza}
